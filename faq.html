                        <p>
                            Solvex paints are formulated with premium quality ingredients and advanced 
                            technology. Our products offer superior coverage, durability, and finish 
                            quality. We also prioritize eco-friendly formulations with low VOC content 
                            and maintain strict quality control standards throughout the manufacturing process.

                            Yes, all Solvex interior paints are formulated with low VOC content and 
                            are safe for use in homes with children and pets. Our paints meet or exceed 
                            all safety standards and are certified for residential use. However, we 
                            recommend proper ventilation during application and allowing the paint to 
                            dry completely before reoccupying the space.

                        <p>
                            The longevity of Solvex paint depends on several factors including surface 
                            preparation, application method, and environmental conditions. Our interior 
                            paints typically last 5-7 years, while exterior paints can last 7-10 years 
                            with proper maintenance. Industrial coatings are designed for even longer 
                            durability depending on the specific application.

                            Coverage varies by product type and surface texture. Generally, our interior 
                            paints cover 12-14 square meters per liter on smooth surfaces, while exterior 
                            paints cover 10-12 square meters per liter. Coverage may be less on rough 
                            or porous surfaces. We recommend consulting our technical data sheets for 
                            specific product coverage information.
